# TrainingRIntro: R Package and Training Material

This repository, TrainingRIntro, serves as a companion package for R Intro Training. It is a unique combination of an R package and training materials designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to R for Air Data Analysis.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this package is to facilitate the learning process for those new to R, particularly in the field of Air Data Analysis. It provides a structured approach to learning, with materials covering a wide range of topics essential for data analysis in R.

## How it Works

The `TrainingRIntro` package includes a series of R scripts and data files that correspond to various sections of the training material. These scripts provide practical examples of the concepts covered in the training, allowing you to learn by doing.

## Installation

To install this package, you need to have the `remotes` package installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using the command `install.packages("remotes")`.

Once you have `remotes` installed, you can install the TrainingRIntro package using the following command:

    remotes::install_github("FluentData/TrainingRIntro")

## Training Materials

The training materials are divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific topic. Here are the links to each section:

1. [Introduction to R](./inst/1-Introduction-to-R)
2. [Functions and Importing Data](./inst/2-Functions-and-Importing-Data)
3. [Subsetting, Sorting, and Dates](./inst/3-Subsetting-Sorting-and-Dates)
4. [Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops](./inst/4-Writing-Functions-Conditionals-and-Loops)
5. [Plotting](./inst/5-Plotting)
6. [Basic Statistics](./inst/6-Basic-Statistics)
7. [Regression and Data Transformation](./inst/7-Regression-and-Data-Transformation)
8. [Quality Assurance](./inst/8-Quality-Assurance)

Each section contains a set of R scripts and data files that you can use to follow along with the training.
